## Problem Solutions

Here are some of the problems included in this repository:

1. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**
   - Language: C++
   - Description: Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. Return the number of unique elements.

2. **Reverse Integer**
   - Language: Java
   - Description: Given a signed 32-bit integer `x`, return `x` with its digits reversed. If reversing `x` causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range, then return 0.

3. **Valid Palindrome**
   - Language: C
   - Description: A phrase is a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase and removing all non-alphanumeric characters.

4. **Length of Last Word**
   - Language: C#
   - Description: Given a string `s`, return the length of the last word in the string.

5. **Power of Three**
   - Language: C++
   - Description: Given an integer `n`, return true if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return false.

6. **Same Tree**
   - Language: Java
   - Description: Given the root of a binary tree, return true if it is the same tree as another binary tree.

7. **Remove Element**
   - Language: Java
   - Description: Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` in-place.
